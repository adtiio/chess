# Multiplayer Chess Game

This is a real-time multiplayer chess game built with **Java Spring Boot** and **WebSockets**. The project allows multiple users to play chess against each other in real time, handling all the game logic, piece movements, and user sessions efficiently using Spring Boot's WebSocket capabilities.


## Technologies Used

- **Java 17+**: For writing the backend logic.
- **Spring Boot**: Used for building the web application and handling RESTful APIs.
- **WebSockets**: For establishing real-time communication between clients (players).
- **Maven**: For dependency management and project build lifecycle.
- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript**: Frontend technologies for creating the user interface of the chess game.
- **Thymeleaf**: Template engine for rendering dynamic HTML pages.
- **Stomp.js**: JavaScript library used on the client-side for WebSocket communication.

## Features

- **Real-time Multiplayer Chess**: Players can play against each other in real time.
- **Session Management**: Tracks playersâ€™ sessions and allows them to join, leave, and reconnect to the game.
- **Turn-based system**: The game enforces turn-based rules for chess.
- **Move Validation**: The system checks the validity of each player's move before executing it.
- **Visual Chessboard**: A dynamic chessboard UI that updates in real-time based on player moves.
- **Endgame detection**: The system detects check, checkmate, stalemate, and other endgame scenarios.
